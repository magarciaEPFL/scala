     *  When writing classfiles with "optimization level zero" (ie -Ybackend:GenBCode)
     *  the very least we want to do is remove dead code beforehand,
     *  so as to prevent an artifact of stack-frames computation from showing up,
     *  the artifact described at http://asm.ow2.org/doc/developer-guide.html#deadcode
     *  That artifact results from the requirement by the Java 6 split verifier
     *  that a stack map frame be available for each basic block, even unreachable ones.
     *
     *  Just removing dead code might leave stale LocalVariableTable entries
     *  thus `cleanseMethod()` also gets rid of those.
